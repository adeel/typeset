# typeset

A Clojure DSL for typesetting documents that consist of claims and their
proofs.  Currently renders only HTML but at some point LaTeX output may be
implemented.

## Usage

    (render :html {:numbering-prefix "1.1."}
      (claim (text "The open subsets of a topological space " (math "X")
                   " form a category " (math "\\mathrm{Top}(X)") ".")
             (para "We have as morphisms the inclusion maps " (math "U \\to V")
                   " for any inclusions " (math "V \\subseteq U") ", "
                   (math "U") " and " (math "V") " open subsets of X.")
             (para "Another paragraph."))
      (claim (text "This is the second claim.")
             (para "This is in the body of the second claim.")
             (para "And this is another paragraph.")))
